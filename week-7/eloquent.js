Intro
Did you learn anything new about JavaScript or programming in general?
I learned a lot about the history of programming as well as the development of the language of Javascript.

Are there any concepts you are uncomfortable with?
I was a little uncomfortable when the book started giving examples of javascript. I wasn't sure if we were supposed to already understand what he was writing.

CH.1
Number similarities: Both recognize the input of whole numbers and non whole numbers like so: 34 or 3.4
Number differences: JavaScript has a finite amount of bits that are required to make that number come into existence, the number is bits is so large though that you only need to worry about not having enough bits if you are working with extremely high numbers.

Arithmetic similarities: Javascript and Ruby both use the same operators and also follow the order of operations.
Arithmetic differences: Javascript recognizes three special numbers, infinity, negative infinity, and nan.

String similarities: They are denoted in the same manner, using either double or single quotation marks and can also be concatenated together.
String differences: Javascript has characters that will automatically escape out of a string, also you can output on different lines and tab by using a backslash followed by a n for a new line and a t for tab, anything following a backslash will not be counted.

Boolean similarities: Able to output either true or false values using the same greater than less than symbols, and they &&, || characters.
Boolean differences: Javascript also accepts a question mark and a colon format.

CH.2
What is an expression?
It is a fragment of code that produces a value.

What is the purpose of semicolons in Javascript? Are they always required?
Semicolons show where expressions end and are not always required.

What causes a variable to return undefined?
When you define a variable without giving it a value.

What does console.log do and when would you use it? What Ruby methods is this similar to?
Console.log outputs the value in the parenthesis following it, so you would want to use it when you want to see the value of something. This is similar to p, puts, and print in Ruby.

Describe while and for loops.
The while loop is followed by a statement and executes that statement as long as that statement remains true. The for loop is a shorter way to create those boundaries often used in while loops without having to use a counter.
What other similarities or differences did you notice between Javascript and Ruby did you notice in this section?
I noticed that they have a lot of the same terminology, however they often have different qualities and small details about them that are different.
