#What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a skeleton that you build of your website to generally plan where you want things and how you want it to look.

#What are the benefits of wireframing?

Wireframming is beneficial because you can visualize what your site will look like and plan accordingly. It helps organize information in it's earliest stage.

#Did you enjoy wireframming your site?

I did enjoy wireframing my site, I even feel as though I spent too much time worrying whether or not it looked good.

#Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I definitely revised my wireframe, whenever I plan how things look I always end up changing my mind.

#What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I didn't have many quesitons with this wireframing challenge. At first I did take a while getting a hang of using the wireframing website mockingbird.But what took most of the time is trying to figure out how to get my images to display correctly using markdown. I ended up asking some of my peers.

#Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I enjoyed imagining what I wanted my website to look like. I never knew there were so many tools to help you wireframe so quickly.
