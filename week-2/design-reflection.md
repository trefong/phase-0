The primary actions that I want the user to take is to contact me, and look through my portfolio.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
The main things that someone should know about design and user experience is that they come hand in hand. Design greatly affects user experience and vice versa. They should know that it is very important, that there are many ways to do it "correctly", and that it takes a lot of trial and error.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
User experience design is of the utmost importance because it is the first impression a user gets and can be the difference between making a sale and losing a customer. It is the combination of design, organization, and marketing that makes a user want to continue using the site and doing it poorly can deter them all together.
