  What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
    It was a little unnerving to translate what I had learned in HTML into building an actual site because we were starting from scratch and
  How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

  How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

  What seems good and bad about HTML?

  What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
