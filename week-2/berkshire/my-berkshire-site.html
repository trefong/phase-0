<!--
  What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
    It was a little unnerving to translate what I had learned in HTML into building an actual site because we were starting from scratch and didn't really have a starting place. But once we got into the rhthym of things it went very smoothly.
  How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  It was actually pretty easy researching and using semantic HTML5 elements because the resources are all pretty straightforward.

  How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  It was a little difficult to not format in the HTML because when things don't look nice you want to change them. But I felt we kept it as simple as possible.

  What seems good and bad about HTML?
  HTML is good at creating a framework for your site and building off of that. The bad thing about HTML is that it seems somewhat limitting since most of the details are done in other languages.

  What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  One trick that I found works is when you have to use a new element, type it out as much as you can instead of copying and pasting it so then you can get solidified in your brain.
