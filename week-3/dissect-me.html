    <h1>Version Control Git/GitHub</h1>
    <p>The first thing that should be explained is what Git and GitHub are. Git is a program run in your command line that allows you to store, manage, and even go back to different points in the development of a file. For example, I could go back to when I had just wrote the first line, even if I had already gotten to the end.You get to establish these points as you deem fit which is another reason why it's so handy. I can mark when I was working on a certain part of a file specifically so that I know what I was working on if I wanted to go back to it in the future. It also helps if you somehow deleted part of your file. You can always go back to an earlier version to retrieve it again.</p>

    <p>Another great tool for not only backing up files but sharing them is GitHub. It keeps your code in a safe place in case anything should happen to the files on your computer. In addition, it allows for easy collaboration on a single project by creating different channels for people to edit the code, and then come back together to discuss the changes before they are final.</p>

    <p>What are the benefits of version control? I've learned a lot of new information in my first week at Dev Bootcamp. Version control is an extremely important tool to use when coding. It is a system that records changes to a file over time so that you can keep track of all revisions made. It allows you to compare changes over time, see who made a revision (and why), and revert back to an earlier version before a specific change was made (perhaps due to an issue caused by the change). Basically, version control allows you to easily get back to a working version of your file if something goes wrong.</p>

  What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
  Common tags that I have used are header, footer, and article. I've come back to them alot because they important when creating constant parts to a webpage.

  How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browswer uses to display elements?
  Elements get laid out on the page aligned to the right as a defualt. Elements are displayed by the browser from the top of the page to the bottom.

  What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
  I learned that Sublime has some really useful shortcuts in this challenge. I think that I will definitely look into the other snippets they offer and also create my own.
