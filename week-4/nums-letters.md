#What does puts do?
Puts returns the out put and prints it to the console in a new line.
#What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a number without a decimal point. Numbers with a decimal point is called a float or floating-point numbers.

#What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
The main difference between float and integer division is that integer division only returns integer answers. In other words, it will always round down to the nearest integer if the answer is a float.

#How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Ruby handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division like a calculator would with the exception of integer division.

#What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
Strings are are groups of letters in a program. You would use them if you want to use text.

#What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
Local varibables are the names of the assignments in the form of any sequence of letters and numbers who's first character needs to be lowercase. You need to use local variables when you want to store a procedure to use later because those procedures need names.

#How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
This challenge was a little bit hard for me in the beggining because it was a different format of learning the material than what we have been doing.Overall I felt like I got a good understanding of the basics largely because the book was helpful and easy to read.
