#1.1 Think About Time Reflection
Some of the time management strategies that I learned about are the Fogg Method, Time Boxing, and the Pomodoro Technique. I found all of the methods extremely interesting and helpful because they approached time management and productivity from a new direction and challenged the older ideas that have been in place. Time Boxing is the method of time management that suggests breaking up your work time into small increments and then evaluated what was accomplished. In this way, you have structure when working on a task, instead of aimlessly working until completed, which can be filled with non-working/time-wasting activities. I currently am guilty of what the Pomodoro Technique is trying to avoid. I simply designate large chunks of "working time", and stop when the task it is completed. I feel that keeping motivated and constantly working is important for me to finish a task. I think that my time management method could use work because I know that I get off task easily. As a result, my time is unstructured and a lot of my "working time" could actually be filled with more "surfing-the-web time" than I think. My plan for managing my time during Phase 0 will be to implement the the idea in the Pomodoro Technique to keep track of how long I work on challenges. I think that will be helpful to me because I know that I can easily get carried away working instead of taking the time to evaluate how I've used my time. I also like the idea explained in the Fogg Method for staying motivated to start a task by using small habits in your daily life as triggers. In this way, I can get used to start working by building off events that are already in my daily routine and will help me avoid procrastination.
##1.2 The Command Line Reflection
Shell is the program that allows you to control what your computer does and bash is the language it understands. The most challenging part of the material was getting used to not seeing the graphical representation of what you were doing and learning to understand the text that was being output by the Shell. I was able to use all of the commands successfully. I think the most important commands to know is the command that helps you look up other commands if you've forgotten them, the pipe command, and the viewing files command.

pwd: shows you where you are in your computer

ls: shows what is inside a directory

mv: moves a file or directory

cd: change what directory you're in

../: move "up" a directory

touch: make a file

mkdir: make a directory

less: page through a file

rmdir: remove a directory

rm: remove file

help: gives you command help
###1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
Instructions to create a new Repository:
First go to GitHub, in the top right hand corner there is  "+" symbol. Click that symbol and select "new repository" from the drop down menu. Next type in a name for your repository, make it public, and and the MIT License agreement, all of which will be options in the pop up window that appears. After you will click "create repository", You should be able to see your new repository in your library.

Instructions to fork a Repository:
Go to the page of the repository that you would like to fork. Click the "fork" button located in the upper right hand side of the page. It will automatically fork that repository to your own profile. You can see it if you navigate back to your own profile.

Instructions to clone a Repository:
Click on the repository that you would like to clone. On the menu bar located on top of the files copy the HTTP link. Next to to the terminal, navigate to where you want to place your repository and type git clone and then the HTTPS link you copied.

You would want to fork a repository to make a copy into your own account from someone else's. You would want to clone a repository so that you can get a copy on to your computer so that you can begin actually working on it.

I didn't have any many problems setting up Git or GitHub, they were pretty straight forward.  Along the way I learned that the ideas of Git and GitHub are very similar to edit history and features of Google docs.
